 1	Create the HTML structure: Use HTML to create the basic structure of the webpage, including elements such as a heading, a form for adding new bookmarks, and a container for displaying the existing bookmarks.
2	Use CSS to style the webpage: Use CSS to style the HTML elements, such as changing the font, color, and layout of the webpage.
3	Add JavaScript functionality: Use JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage. This can include things like:
	-Using JavaScript to capture the form submission and add the 	new bookmark to the list.
	-Using JavaScript to retrieve the bookmarks from the browser's local storage and display them on the webpage.
	-Using JavaScript to allow users to delete bookmarks from the list.
	-Using JavaScript to filter the bookmarks by tags or categories.
4	browser's local storage, which allows the bookmarks to persist even when the user closes the browser or turns off their computer. Alternatively, you could use a server-side database to store the bookmarks, such as MySQL, MongoDB or Firebase.
5	Add server-side functionality: If you want to enable users to share their bookmarks with others, or to access their bookmarks from multiple devices, you'll need to use a server-side technology to authenticate users and store their bookmarks on the server. You can use a framework like Node.js, Express, or Ruby on Rails to build a RESTful API that interacts with the database and handles the server-side functionality.
6	Test and deploy: Once you have completed the development, you should thoroughly test the website on different browsers and devices. Once you are satisfied, you can deploy the website to a web host or cloud service, such as GitHub Pages, Heroku, or AWS.
